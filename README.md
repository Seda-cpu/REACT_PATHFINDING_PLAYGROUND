# 🐾 Path Planning Simulation

This is an interactive 3D **grid-based pathfinding simulator** developed using React, Three.js, and Node.js.  
You can place obstacles, define targets, and watch a robot (a cute animated cat!) find its way using A* or Dijkstra algorithms.

## 🤖 About This Project

This project was created as a way to **learn and explore React and React Three Fiber**.  
Along the way, I got a little help from **ChatGPT** to experiment, troubleshoot, and improve things one step at a time.

> It’s not just a simulator — it’s a personal learning playground in disguise 🚀
